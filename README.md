# ExperimentalGame

Simple game skeleton to be developed into a complex Game



### Setup

The project is set up for Intellij IDEA 15

If you aren't using it, only the java files in `src/` are needed.



### JavaDoc

can be viewed at http://koucha.github.io/ExperimentalGame/

It's not guaranteed to always be up to date.
But the docs shouldn't change much anyways.

These docs are intended to help grasp the structure and inner workings of this project.
Therefore they list even private members.
Also, since that's the case, the documentation might contain minor infos about the implementation.
