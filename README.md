# ExperimentalGame

Simple game skeleton to be developed into a complex Game

Not much to write yet xD



### Setup

The project is set up for Intellij IDEA 15

If you aren't using it, only the java files in `src/` are needed.



### JavaDoc

can be viewed at http://koucha.github.io/ExperimentalGame/

It's not guaranteed to always be up to date. But the docs shouldn't change much anyways.
