# ExperimentalGame

Simple game skeleton to be developed into a complex Game



## Setup

The project is set up for Intellij IDEA 2016

If you aren't using it, you can ignore `.idea/`

Maven is used for managing dependencies and the build process

#### Branches

`working` - intended to be modified

`master` - main branch 'protected', working should be merged into master if stable

`oldMaster` - former main branch 'protected' holds the project before it moved to maven

`gh-pages` - holds the JavaDoc pages, not protected but modifying commits are discouraged because unnecessary


## JavaDoc

can be viewed at http://koucha.github.io/ExperimentalGame/

It's not guaranteed to always be up to date.
But the docs shouldn't change much anyways.

The docs are intended to help grasp the structure and inner workings of this project.
Therefore they list even private members.
Also, since that's the case, the documentation might contain minor infos about the implementation.
